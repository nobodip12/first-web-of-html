        Nobodip Chandra Roy was an eminent Indian mathematician renowned for his contributions to number theory and algebra. Born on June 30, 1887, in Bangladesh, which was then part of British India, he made significant strides in the field of mathematics despite
         facing various challenges in his early life. Roy's work encompassed diverse areas, including number
          theory, algebraic geometry, and algebraic equations.

One of his most notable achievements was his work on perfect numbers, for which he devised a criterion known as
 Roy's theorem. This theorem provided a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an odd perfect
  number, a long-standing problem in number theory. Roy's contributions to perfect numbers earned him 
  international recognition among mathematicians.

Moreover, Roy made significant contributions to the theory of Diophantine equations, which involve finding
integer solutions to polynomial equations. His insights into Diophantine equations contributed to advancements
 in algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry.

Despite his profound contributions to mathematics, Roy's work remained relatively underrecognized during his
 lifetime. However, his legacy continues to inspire mathematicians and researchers in various branches of
  mathematics, particularly in number theory and algebra
